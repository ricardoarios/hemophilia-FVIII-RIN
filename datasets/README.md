### Here is a description of each dataset used in the study.

> - **10_folds_classification_result.csv:** - This is the results of the 10-fold classification displayed in Figure 3a of the manuscript, using 3 classifiers.
> - **2r7e_network_formatted.csv:** - This is the FVIII Residue Interaction Network (RIN), prepared using the structure determined by Shen et al., Blood 2008 (PDB ID 2R7E). For the details of how the network was obtained, please refer to the “Methods” of our manuscript.
> - **A2_mutagenesis.csv:** - This contains the chromogenic and the antigen binding (expression levels) of the mutant constructs prepared using alanine mutations. This is for the A2 domain only (Plantier et al., Thrombosis and Haemostasis, 2012).
> - **C2_mutagenesis.csv:** - This contains the chromogenic and the antigen binding (expression levels) of the mutant constructs prepared using alanine mutations. This is for the C2 domain only (Pellequer et al., Thrombosis and Haemostasis, 2011).
> - **binding_sites_only.csv:** - These is a list of residues reported to be involved in interactions with other coagulation factors and the phospholipid membrane of platelets. For the list of references, please refer to our manuscript.
> - **Relative_Surf_Area_2R7E.csv:** - We calculated the relative exposure of all amino acids, indicating their degree of burial in a structure. Relative exposures were calculated by normalizing the surface area of the residue by the surface area of the same type of residue in a reference state (we used the reference values by Bendell CJ et al., Bioinformatics 2014, of the solvent-excluded surface areas of the 20 standard amino acids in Gly-X-Gly tripeptides).
> - **RIN_pred_chromo.csv:** - The predicted chromogenic activity of residues from the A1, A3 and C1 domains. This is the output of the ensemble of classifiers.
